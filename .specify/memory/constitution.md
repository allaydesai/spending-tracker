# Spending Tracker Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First
Code MUST be maintainable, readable, and follow established patterns. All code changes require proper formatting using automated tools (ESLint, Prettier). Type safety is mandatory where applicable (TypeScript). Code reviews are required for all changes. Documentation MUST be updated when interfaces change.

*Rationale: Personal projects benefit from professional standards to ensure long-term maintainability and learning value.*

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests MUST be written before implementation. All features require unit tests with minimum 80% coverage. Integration tests MUST cover user workflows. Contract tests MUST validate data interfaces. Tests MUST pass before merging any code.

*Rationale: Financial data requires reliability. TDD ensures robust implementation and prevents regression bugs that could corrupt spending data.*

### III. User Experience Consistency
Interface design MUST follow consistent patterns across all screens. User interactions MUST provide immediate feedback. Error messages MUST be clear and actionable. Navigation MUST be intuitive and predictable. Visual hierarchy MUST guide users toward primary actions.

*Rationale: Personal finance tools require trust through professional, consistent interfaces that reduce cognitive load.*

### IV. Mobile-First Design
All interfaces MUST be responsive and touch-friendly. Performance on mobile devices MUST not degrade. Touch targets MUST meet accessibility guidelines (44px minimum). Content MUST be readable without zooming. Offline functionality MUST be supported where possible.

*Rationale: Expense tracking happens on-the-go. Mobile usability is essential for real-world adoption and regular use.*

### V. Performance Excellence
Page load times MUST be under 2 seconds on standard connections. Data processing MUST handle files up to 10MB. Memory usage MUST remain under 512MB during normal operation. Bundle sizes MUST be optimized and measured. Performance regressions MUST be detected and addressed.

*Rationale: Slow financial tools discourage regular use. Performance directly impacts user adoption and data entry consistency.*

## Performance Standards

**Response Time Requirements:**
- Dashboard load: <2 seconds
- Data import: <5 seconds for typical Excel files
- Chart rendering: <1 second
- Search/filter operations: <500ms

**Resource Constraints:**
- Memory usage: <512MB peak
- Bundle size: <2MB compressed
- Database queries: <100ms p95
- File processing: Support up to 10MB Excel files

**Scalability Targets:**
- Support 5+ years of transaction data
- Handle 10,000+ transactions efficiently
- Maintain performance with multiple Excel files

## Development Workflow

**Code Review Process:**
- All changes require pull request review
- Automated testing must pass before review
- Performance impact must be assessed
- Security implications must be considered

**Quality Gates:**
- Linting and formatting checks (automated)
- Type checking (where applicable)
- Test coverage minimum 80%
- Performance benchmarks must pass
- Accessibility standards compliance

**Deployment Standards:**
- Staging environment testing required
- Data backup before schema changes
- Rollback plan for breaking changes
- User data migration validation

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Changes to core principles require documentation of rationale and impact assessment. All pull requests must verify compliance with constitutional principles. Complexity deviations must be explicitly justified in code reviews.

Performance regressions violating established standards require immediate attention. Security issues take precedence over feature development. User data integrity is non-negotiable.

Runtime development guidance is maintained in project documentation and agent-specific files.
