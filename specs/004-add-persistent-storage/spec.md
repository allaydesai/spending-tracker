# Feature Specification: Persistent Storage for Transactions

**Feature Branch**: `004-add-persistent-storage`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add persistent storage for transactions using simple sqlite. user can review stored data or add new data from csv. it is important to not duplicate transactions. start with very simple solution and minimal in features, remember its for personal use."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature requires SQLite-based transaction storage with CSV import capability
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: personal user; Actions: store, review, import from CSV; Data: transactions; Constraints: no duplicates, simple minimal solution
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Transaction schema definition needed
   � Duplicate detection criteria needs clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Main flow: import CSV � store � review stored data
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Focus on core storage, import, and review capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities (transaction data)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Spec focuses on user needs without implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a personal user tracking my spending, I want to store my transaction data permanently so that I can continuously build up my spending history by importing CSV files, and then visualize this accumulated data through the dashboard without needing to re-upload files each time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a CSV file with transaction data, **When** I import the file, **Then** all valid transactions are stored and any duplicates are prevented
2. **Given** I have previously stored transactions, **When** I access the dashboard, **Then** I can see visualizations of all my accumulated transaction history from persistent storage
3. **Given** I import the same CSV file twice, **When** the second import completes, **Then** no duplicate transactions exist in storage
4. **Given** I have an empty database, **When** I first import a CSV file, **Then** all transactions from the file are successfully stored
5. **Given** I have imported multiple CSV files over time, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I see combined visualizations from all imported data without needing to re-upload files

### Edge Cases
- What happens when CSV file has invalid or malformed transaction data?
- How does system handle importing partial CSV files or interrupted imports?
- What happens when storage becomes full or inaccessible?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST persist transaction data permanently between application sessions
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to import transaction data from CSV files
- **FR-003**: System MUST prevent duplicate transactions from being stored
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to view all stored transaction data
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain data integrity during import operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect duplicate transactions based on date+amount+description.
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle CSV files with expected CSV format and columns.
- **FR-008**: System MUST support all dashboard features visualizing the stored data.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Transaction**: Represents a single financial transaction with attributes like date, amount, description, and category
- **Import Session**: Represents a single CSV import operation with success/failure status and duplicate detection results
