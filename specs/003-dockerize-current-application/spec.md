# Feature Specification: Dockerize Application for Home Server Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `003-dockerize-current-application`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Dockerize current application to deploy to local home server which will host this application. Create supporting documents instructing deployment."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: containerize Next.js spending tracker app for home server
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: home user/family members
   ‚Üí Actions: containerize, deploy, host, document
   ‚Üí Data: Next.js application, deployment configs, CSV files
   ‚Üí Constraints: Ubuntu home server, Windows/WSL development, local network only
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Resolved: Ubuntu Server OS with Docker runtime
   ‚Üí Resolved: Simple local network access, no reverse proxy needed
   ‚Üí Resolved: No SSL required for personal home network use
   ‚Üí Resolved: Basic volume persistence for CSV file uploads
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary: Home user deploys containerized app from Windows/WSL to Ubuntu server
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on simple home deployment capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Container image, simple deployment config, basic documentation
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All clarifications resolved for home network deployment
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A home user wants to deploy the spending tracker application as a simple containerized service on their Ubuntu home server. The application should be easily accessible to a few family members on the local network for personal finance tracking, with straightforward deployment from a Windows/WSL development environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an Ubuntu home server with Docker installed, **When** user follows simple deployment instructions, **Then** spending tracker application runs successfully in container
2. **Given** containerized application is running, **When** family members access the application via local network, **Then** all functionality works as expected (CSV upload, charts, filtering)
3. **Given** Docker image built on Windows/WSL, **When** exported and transferred to Ubuntu server, **Then** application deploys without compatibility issues
4. **Given** container is stopped/restarted, **When** application starts again, **Then** previously uploaded CSV files persist

### Edge Cases
- What happens when container runs out of storage space for uploaded CSV files?
- How does system handle container restart with active user sessions?
- What occurs if home server loses power during CSV upload?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a container image that packages the complete Next.js spending tracker application
- **FR-002**: System MUST support persistent storage for user-uploaded CSV files across container restarts
- **FR-003**: User MUST be able to deploy the application using simple Docker commands on Ubuntu server
- **FR-004**: System MUST expose the web application on a configurable port for local network access
- **FR-005**: System MUST include simple deployment documentation with step-by-step instructions
- **FR-006**: Application MUST maintain all existing functionality when running in containerized environment
- **FR-007**: System MUST run on Ubuntu Server with standard Docker installation
- **FR-008**: Container image MUST be exportable from Windows/WSL development environment
- **FR-009**: Application MUST be accessible via simple HTTP on local network (no SSL required)
- **FR-010**: Deployment MUST be simple enough for personal home use without complex orchestration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Container Image**: Packaged application with all dependencies optimized for Ubuntu deployment
- **Deployment Configuration**: Simple Docker run commands with volume mounts and port mapping
- **Persistent Storage**: Volume mount for CSV files that survives container lifecycle
- **Documentation**: Basic step-by-step guide for building, exporting, and deploying on home server
