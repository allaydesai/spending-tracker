## Key Implementation Notes

### From Research Decisions:
- Use custom React component (not third-party calendar library)
- TailwindCSS for styling with responsive design
- date-fns for date calculations with React.useMemo
- CSS Grid for calendar layout
- Dynamic HSL color scale (green‚Üíyellow‚Üíred)

### From Constitution Requirements:
- TDD approach: All tests must fail before implementation
- ‚â•80% unit test coverage required
- <2s dashboard load, <1s calendar render performance targets
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)

### From Data Model:
- 6 core interfaces: DailySpending, CalendarPeriod, HeatmapConfig, CalendarCell, SpendingThresholds, CalendarMetrics
- Zod validation schemas for runtime type checking
- ISO date strings throughout (YYYY-MM-DD format)

### From Contracts:
- CalendarService: 4 methods for data operations
- Component interfaces: SpendingCalendar, CalendarCell, CalendarHeader
- Proper TypeScript interfaces with JSDoc documentation
