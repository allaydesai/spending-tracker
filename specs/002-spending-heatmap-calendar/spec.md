# Feature Specification: Spending Heatmap Calendar

**Feature Branch**: `002-spending-heatmap-calendar`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Spending Heatmap Calendar

Calendar view where each day is color-coded by spending amount (like GitHub's contribution graph)
Quickly identifies high-spending days and patterns (e.g., weekend spending, end-of-month bills)
Click on any day to drill down into that day's transactions"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature: Calendar view with color-coded spending amounts
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: Users viewing spending data
   � Actions: View calendar, identify patterns, drill down into transactions
   � Data: Daily spending amounts, individual transactions
   � Constraints: Visual similarity to GitHub contribution graph
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Time range: User-selectable (current year, current month, all time)
   � Color scale: Red (high) to yellow (mean) to green (low)
   � Transaction drill-down: Display in existing transaction table with linked component updates
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Primary flow: View calendar, identify high-spending days, click for details
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Calendar display, color coding, pattern identification, transaction drill-down
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Daily spending summaries, transaction records
7. Run Review Checklist
   � All clarifications resolved - spec complete
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user tracking my expenses, I want to see a calendar view where each day is visually color-coded based on my spending amount, so I can quickly identify patterns in my spending behavior and investigate high-spending days by clicking on them to see the underlying transactions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have transaction data spanning multiple months, **When** I view the spending heatmap calendar, **Then** I see a calendar grid where each day is colored according to its total spending amount
2. **Given** I'm viewing the heatmap calendar, **When** I observe the color patterns, **Then** I can quickly identify high-spending days, weekend spending trends, and end-of-month bill patterns
3. **Given** I see a high-spending day on the calendar, **When** I click on that day, **Then** I see a detailed breakdown of all transactions for that specific day
4. **Given** I have no transactions for a particular day, **When** I view that day on the calendar, **Then** it appears with a neutral color indicating no spending
5. **Given** I want to understand the color scale, **When** I view the calendar, **Then** I can see a legend showing what spending ranges correspond to each color

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are no transactions in the selected time period?
- How does the system handle days with extremely high spending amounts that might skew the color scale?
- What occurs when clicking on a day with no transactions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a calendar grid showing days with color-coded spending amounts
- **FR-002**: System MUST use a color intensity scale similar to GitHub's contribution graph to represent spending levels
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to click on any day to view detailed transactions for that day
- **FR-004**: System MUST calculate and display daily spending totals from transaction data
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a visual legend explaining the color scale and spending ranges
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle days with no transactions by showing them in a neutral state
- **FR-007**: Calendar MUST allow users to identify spending patterns across Time range for calendar view - current year, current month, all time, which should be user-selectable.
- **FR-008**: Color scale MUST be dynamically calculated based on red (high) yellow (mean) green (low) type of color scale.
- **FR-009**: Transaction drill-down MUST display in the exisiting transaction table. Other related componenets should also update which are linked to the table eg: pie chart.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Daily Spending Summary**: Represents total spending amount for a specific date, derived from transaction data
- **Transaction Record**: Individual spending transactions that contribute to daily totals, includes amount, description, category, and date
