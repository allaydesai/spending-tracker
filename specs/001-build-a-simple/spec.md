# Feature Specification: CSV Transaction Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-simple`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a simple web app that loads a single CSV of already-categorized transactions for one month and turns it into a fast, local-first dashboard. Show top-level KPIs (total spend, income, net) and a category breakdown (bar or pie), with a drill-down table of transactions. The table can be filtered by category, merchant, amount, and text, and sorted to find drivers. Clicking a chart segment filters the table to matching transactions. No bank connectors, no budgets, no MLjust import � visualize � explore for this month"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to understand their monthly spending patterns by uploading a data file (CSV or Excel) containing their categorized financial transactions. They need to quickly see their overall financial position (income vs spending), understand which categories drive their spending, and explore specific transactions to identify spending patterns. The entire process should be fast, work entirely in the browser without server dependencies, and provide immediate visual feedback for data exploration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a CSV or Excel file with categorized transactions, **When** they upload the file, **Then** the dashboard displays within 2 seconds showing KPIs and visualizations
2. **Given** the dashboard is displaying transaction data, **When** the user clicks on a category in the chart, **Then** the transaction table filters to show only transactions from that category
3. **Given** the transaction table is displayed, **When** the user enters text in the search field, **Then** the table updates in real-time to show only matching transactions
4. **Given** transactions are displayed in the table, **When** the user clicks a column header, **Then** the table sorts by that column in ascending/descending order
5. **Given** filters are applied to the table, **When** the user clears a filter, **Then** the table returns to showing all transactions matching remaining filters

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the CSV file format is invalid or missing required columns (`date`, `amount`, `category`, `description`, `merchant`)?
- How does the system handle a CSV with no transactions (empty file)?
- What happens when all transactions are expenses with no income?
- How does the system handle very large CSV files (>10,000 transactions)?
- What happens when transaction amounts contain invalid data (thousands separators, non-numeric values)?
- How does the system handle duplicate transactions (exact matches on date, amount, merchant, description)?
- What happens when transactions span multiple months (validation error)?
- How does the system handle XLSX files with multiple sheets or incorrect sheet name?
- What happens when `is_transfer` is true (excluded from spend/income totals)?
- How does the system handle missing optional columns (`account`, `is_transfer`)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to sort the transaction table by any column
- **FR-011**: System MUST link chart interactions to table filtering (clicking chart segment filters table)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide immediate visual feedback (under 2 seconds) after file upload
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle CSV (UTF-8, comma-separated with header) or XLSX files with these required columns: `date` (YYYY-MM-DD format), `amount` (negative=spend, positive=income), `category`, `description`, `merchant`
- **FR-014**: System MUST work entirely offline after initial page load

- **FR-020**: System MUST persist data in browser localStorage for convenience (cleared only on user request)
- **FR-021**: System MUST support optional columns: `account` (e.g., bank account name), `is_transfer` (boolean to exclude from spend/income totals)
- **FR-022**: System MUST validate that all transactions are within the same month

- **FR-026**: Users MUST be able to export the filtered transaction table to CSV format
- **FR-027**: System SHOULD optionally support export to single-page PDF format

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Transaction**: Represents a single financial transaction with required fields (date, amount, category, merchant, description) and optional fields (account, is_transfer)
- **Category**: A classification for grouping transactions (e.g., Groceries, Housing, Salary, Transfers)
- **KPI**: Calculated metrics including total income (positive amounts), total spending (negative amounts), and net amount (sum), excluding transfers when is_transfer=true
- **Filter**: User-applied criteria to narrow down displayed transactions (by category, merchant, amount range, text search)

### Data Format Example
Expected CSV format with all columns (required and optional):
```csv
date,amount,category,description,merchant,account,is_transfer
2025-09-01,-1850.00,Housing,"Rent - September",Landlord Co,RBC Chequing,false
2025-09-03,-72.43,Groceries,"Walmart Supercentre #1234",Walmart,RBC Visa,false
2025-09-04,2500.00,Salary,"Payroll Sep",Employer Inc,RBC Chequing,false
2025-09-07,-500.00,Transfers,"Credit Card Payment",RBC Visa Payment,RBC Chequing,true
```

**Column specifications:**
- `date`: YYYY-MM-DD format (all within same month)
- `amount`: Decimal with `.` separator, no thousands separators (negative=spend, positive=income)
- `category`: Text classification (e.g., Groceries, Housing, Salary)
- `description`: Raw transaction text from statement
- `merchant`: Normalized merchant name
- `account`: (Optional) Source account identifier
- `is_transfer`: (Optional) Boolean flag to exclude from totals

   - `amount`: Decimal, negative=spend, positive=income
   - `category`: Transaction classification
   - `description`: Raw text from statement
   - `merchant`: Normalized merchant name

3. **Optional Columns**:
   - `account`: Source account identifier
   - `is_transfer`: Boolean flag to exclude from totals

4. **Validation Rules**:
   - Single currency per file (assume CAD if not specified)
   - No thousands separators, decimal point only
   - Remove exact duplicates by (date, amount, merchant, description)
   - All transactions must be within same month
   - Totals must reconcile exactly with rows
