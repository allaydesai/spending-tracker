# Tasks: CSV Transaction Dashboard

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-a-simple/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: React 18+, TypeScript 5.0+, Vite, Recharts, Papa Parse, SheetJS
   → Structure: Single project (frontend-only)
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Transaction, KPI, CategorySummary, Filter entities
   → contracts/: file-parser, data-processor, export-service
   → research.md: Technology decisions and patterns
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: React project, TypeScript config, dependencies
   → Tests: Contract tests for all services (TDD)
   → Core: Type definitions, services, React components
   → Integration: Dashboard assembly, state management
   → Polish: Unit tests, performance, accessibility
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T030)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests
   → All entities have types
   → All services implemented
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify ALL tests fail before implementing features
- Commit after each completed task
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` after implementation
- Test with sample CSV files from quickstart.md
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design throughout

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - file-parser.contract.ts → T006 contract test [P]
   - data-processor.contract.ts → T007 contract test [P]
   - export-service.contract.ts → T008 contract test [P]

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Transaction entity → T013 type definition [P]
   - KPI entity → T013 type definition [P]
   - CategorySummary → T013 type definition [P]
   - Filter → T014 type definition [P]

3. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - File upload scenario → T009 integration test [P]
   - Chart interaction → T011 integration test [P]
   - Export functionality → T012 integration test [P]
   - Performance validation → T037 performance test

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Contract Tests → Integration Tests → Types → Services → Components → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies prevent parallel execution where files overlap
