# Research Phase: CSV Transaction Dashboard

**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Feature**: CSV Transaction Dashboard
**Phase**: 0 - Technology Research & Decisions

## Technology Decisions

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: React 18+ with TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Local-first architecture requires robust client-side state management
- React's component model ideal for dashboard UI with charts, tables, and filters
- TypeScript provides type safety for financial data processing
- Large ecosystem for CSV parsing, charting, and PDF generation
- Excellent mobile-first responsive design capabilities

**Alternatives considered**:
- Vue 3: Good option but smaller ecosystem for financial data libraries
- Svelte: Excellent performance but limited charting library options
- Vanilla JS: Would require building too many components from scratch

### CSV/Excel Processing
**Decision**: Papa Parse (CSV) + SheetJS (Excel)
**Rationale**:
- Papa Parse: Industry standard for CSV parsing in browsers, handles large files efficiently
- SheetJS: Comprehensive Excel file support, works entirely client-side
- Both libraries support streaming for large files
- No server dependency required

**Alternatives considered**:
- CSV-Parser: Limited Excel support
- XLSX.js: Good but less maintained than SheetJS
- File API only: Would require implementing parser from scratch

### Charting Library
**Decision**: Recharts
**Rationale**:
- React-native charts with excellent TypeScript support
- Responsive design built-in for mobile-first approach
- Click event handling for chart-to-table filtering
- Smaller bundle size than Chart.js + React wrapper
- Declarative API matches React patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Chart.js: More features but larger bundle, requires wrapper for React
- D3.js: Most powerful but overkill for simple bar/pie charts
- Victory: Good alternative but larger bundle size

### State Management
**Decision**: React Context + useReducer
**Rationale**:
- Single-page application with moderately complex state
- No need for external state manager like Redux for local-first app
- Context provides good performance for dashboard state
- useReducer handles complex transaction filtering logic

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux Toolkit: Overkill for single-page local app
- Zustand: Good option but Context is sufficient
- useState only: Would become unwieldy with complex filters

### Styling Strategy
**Decision**: CSS Modules + Tailwind CSS
**Rationale**:
- CSS Modules prevent style conflicts between components
- Tailwind provides consistent design system and rapid mobile-first development
- Small bundle size when purged properly
- Excellent responsive design utilities

**Alternatives considered**:
- Styled-components: Runtime overhead not ideal for performance targets
- Pure CSS: Would require building design system from scratch
- Material-UI: Too heavy for simple dashboard design

### Data Persistence
**Decision**: Browser localStorage
**Rationale**:
- Local-first requirement mandates client-side storage
- localStorage provides persistent data between sessions
- Simple API for financial data that doesn't require complex queries
- No security concerns since data never leaves user's browser

**Alternatives considered**:
- IndexedDB: Overkill for simple key-value storage needs
- sessionStorage: Would lose data on browser close
- No persistence: Poor user experience

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest + React Testing Library + MSW
**Rationale**:
- Jest: Industry standard for JavaScript testing
- RTL: Best practices for testing React components from user perspective
- MSW: Mock file upload/processing APIs for integration tests
- Covers TDD requirement with 80% coverage target

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cypress: Overkill for local-first app with no server
- Vitest: Good option but Jest has broader ecosystem
- Enzyme: Deprecated and doesn't follow testing best practices

### Build System
**Decision**: Vite
**Rationale**:
- Fastest build system for React/TypeScript projects
- Excellent development experience with HMR
- Built-in TypeScript support and ES modules
- Optimal for meeting 2-second load time target

**Alternatives considered**:
- Create React App: Slower builds and outdated dependencies
- Webpack: More complex configuration required
- Parcel: Good but less ecosystem support

### Bundle Size Optimization
**Decision**: Dynamic imports + code splitting
**Rationale**:
- Chart library and Excel parsing can be loaded on-demand
- Meets <2MB bundle size constraint
- Improves initial page load performance

**Strategies**:
- Lazy load chart components until data is uploaded
- Dynamic import of SheetJS for Excel files only
- Tree shaking for unused Tailwind classes

### Performance Monitoring
**Decision**: Web Vitals + React DevTools Profiler
**Rationale**:
- Web Vitals provides Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, FID, CLS)
- React DevTools Profiler identifies component rendering bottlenecks
- Browser-native tools, no external dependencies

**Metrics to track**:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
- Time to Interactive (TTI) < 3.5s
- Memory usage < 512MB

## Architecture Patterns

### Component Architecture
**Pattern**: Container/Presenter pattern with custom hooks
**Rationale**:
- Separation of business logic (containers) from UI (presenters)
- Custom hooks for reusable data processing logic
- Easy to test business logic independently

### Data Flow
**Pattern**: Unidirectional data flow with Context
**Structure**:
```
File Upload → Parser Service → Transaction Store (Context) → Components
                     ↓
Chart Interactions → Filter Actions → Updated Store → Re-render
```

### Error Handling
**Pattern**: Error boundaries + toast notifications
**Strategy**:
- Error boundaries catch component errors
- Toast system for user-facing error messages
- Graceful degradation for malformed data

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- Node.js 18+ (for latest React features)
- TypeScript 5.0+ (for latest strict mode features)
- ESLint + Prettier (code quality)
- VS Code + TypeScript extension (development experience)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Large file processing**: Mitigated by streaming parsers and Web Workers
2. **Memory usage**: Mitigated by virtualized table and efficient data structures
3. **Browser compatibility**: Mitigated by targeting modern browsers only
4. **Bundle size**: Mitigated by code splitting and tree shaking

### Performance Risks
1. **Chart rendering with 10k+ data points**: Use data aggregation and virtualization
2. **Real-time filtering**: Implement debouncing and efficient filter algorithms
3. **Mobile performance**: Optimize for mobile-first design and touch interactions

### User Experience Risks
1. **File format errors**: Provide clear validation messages and format examples
2. **Empty or invalid data**: Graceful handling with helpful error messages
3. **Complex filtering**: Progressive disclosure and clear filter indicators
