# Implementation Plan: CSV Transaction Dashboard

**Branch**: `001-build-a-simple` | **Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-a-simple/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Local-first web application for CSV transaction dashboard analysis. Users upload a single CSV/Excel file containing pre-categorized transactions for one month to visualize spending patterns through KPIs (total spend, income, net) and interactive category charts (bar/pie). Features include drill-down transaction table with filtering/sorting capabilities, chart-to-table linking, and CSV/PDF export. Built with React/TypeScript for browser-only processing with 2-second load time target and mobile-first design.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, React 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Chart.js/Recharts, Papa Parse (CSV), SheetJS (Excel), jsPDF
**Storage**: Browser localStorage (local-first, no server)
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, MSW (API mocking)
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
**Project Type**: web - determines frontend structure
**Performance Goals**: <2s dashboard load, <5s file import, 60fps chart interactions
**Constraints**: <512MB memory usage, <2MB bundle size, offline-capable after initial load
**Scale/Scope**: Single user, 10k+ transactions per file, 5+ years of data retention

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Frontend-only web application with no backend required due to local-first architecture

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Contract tests for file-parser, data-processor, and export-service [P]
- Data model implementations for Transaction, KPI, Filter entities [P]
- Service layer implementations for parsing, processing, exporting
- React component tasks for dashboard, charts, table, filters
- Integration tests based on quickstart scenarios
- Performance optimization and accessibility tasks

**Ordering Strategy (TDD Approach)**:
1. **Foundation Layer** [P]: TypeScript types, data models, utility functions
2. **Service Layer Tests** [P]: Contract tests for all services (failing tests first)
3. **Service Layer Implementation**: File parser → Data processor → Export service
4. **Component Layer Tests** [P]: React component tests (RTL-based)
5. **Component Layer Implementation**: UI components → Dashboard assembly
6. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end user scenarios from quickstart.md
7. **Performance & Polish**: Bundle optimization, accessibility, mobile testing

**Specific Task Categories**:
- **Contract Tests (3 tasks)**: File parser, data processor, export service validation
- **Type Definitions (2 tasks)**: Core types and interfaces, validation schemas
- **Service Implementation (6 tasks)**: CSV/Excel parsing, KPI calculation, filtering, sorting, export functionality
- **React Components (8 tasks)**: File upload, KPI display, charts, transaction table, filters, export buttons
- **Integration (4 tasks)**: Main dashboard assembly, routing, state management, error handling
- **Testing & QA (5 tasks)**: End-to-end scenarios, performance testing, accessibility audit, mobile testing
- **Build & Deploy (2 tasks)**: Bundle optimization, production build configuration

**Performance Considerations**:
- Tasks 1-10: Can be executed in parallel (independent components)
- Tasks 11-20: Sequential implementation following dependency order
- Tasks 21-30: Integration and testing phases

**Estimated Output**: 30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md with clear dependencies and parallel execution markers

**Testing Strategy per Task**:
- Each service task includes both unit tests and contract validation
- Each component task includes React Testing Library component tests
- Integration tasks include full user workflow validation
- Performance tasks include Web Vitals measurements and memory profiling

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
